Relative Positioning


Anchors with a .button class are floated to the right of our <h3>, but we'd like them to be centered vertically. Use relative positioning to move the button down 3px.

style.css

.button {
  float: right;
}

Answer:

.button {
  float: right;
  position: relative;
  top: 3px;
}
