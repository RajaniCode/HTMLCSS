2.1 Importing I


We've added a slight transition to our anchor color, but we were a bit overzealous: without Compass imported, the transition mixin isn't available. Add Compass to the top of our stylesheet to rectify this situation.


CSS

Undefined mixin 'transition'.

.SASS

a
  +transition(color 0.2s ease-in-out)
  color: blue
  &:hover,
  &:focus
    color: red

.SCSS

a {
  @include transition(color 0.2s ease-in-out);
  color: blue;
  &:hover,
  &:focus {
    color: red;
  }
}

Answer:

.SASS

@import "compass"
a
  +transition(color 0.2s ease-in-out)
  color: blue
  &:hover,
  &:focus
    color: red

.SCSS

@import "compass";

a {
  @include transition(color 0.2s ease-in-out);
  color: blue;
  &:hover,
  &:focus {
    color: red;
  }
}

CSS

a {
  -webkit-transition: color 0.2s ease-in-out;
  -moz-transition: color 0.2s ease-in-out;
  -o-transition: color 0.2s ease-in-out;
  transition: color 0.2s ease-in-out;
  color: blue; }
  a:hover, a:focus {
    color: red; }
