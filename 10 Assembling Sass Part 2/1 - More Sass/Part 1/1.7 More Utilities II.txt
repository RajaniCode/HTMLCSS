The text color of .worksite is dependent on the number of members in our crew. Let's update the conditional statement to use the single-line if() for brevity.



CSS

.worksite {
  color: green;
}

.SASS

$crew: judy phillip william emily

.worksite
  @if length($crew) < 5
    color: green
  @else 
    color: red

.SCSS

$crew: judy phillip william emily;

.worksite {
  @if length($crew) < 5 {
    color: green;
  }
  @else {
    color: red;
  }
}
