5.3 Sprite Map I


Oh. They weren't logo variations after all - these images are the default, hover, and active states of a link. It'll be easier to handle this manually, so let's start by removing the automatic import and mixin. After that, set an appropriate sprite-map to a variable called $logos.

CSS

.SASS

@import "compass"
@import "logos/*.png"
+all-logos-sprites

.SCSS

@import "compass";
@import "logos/*.png";

@include all-logos-sprites;

Answer:

.SASS

@import compass

$logos: sprite-map("logos/*.png")

.SCSS

@import "compass";

$logos: sprite-map("logos/*.png");
