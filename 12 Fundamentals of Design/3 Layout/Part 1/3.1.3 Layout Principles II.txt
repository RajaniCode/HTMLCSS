3.1.3 Layout Principles II


Using one of each element, create a layout that follows the principles of visual hierarchy using a Vertical Navigation element.

Hint:

1. Place the brand in the upper left of the layout, and place the vertical navigation directly below the brand.

2. Drop the main content right next to the navigation.

3. Place the secondary content right next to the main content, and place the footer directly below both content pieces.
