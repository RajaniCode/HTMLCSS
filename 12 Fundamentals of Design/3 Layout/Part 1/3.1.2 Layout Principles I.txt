3.1.2 Layout Principles I

Using one of each element, create a layout that follows the principles of visual hierarchy using a Horizontal Navigation element.

Hint:

1. Place the brand in the upper left of the layout and the horizontal navigation directly next to the brand.

2. Drop the main content directly below the brand and navigation.

3. Place the secondary content directly below the main content, and place the footer on the bottom of the layout.
