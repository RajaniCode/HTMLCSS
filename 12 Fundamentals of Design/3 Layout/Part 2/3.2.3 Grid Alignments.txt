3.2.3 Grid Alignments

Use all of the elements in a grid-based design.

Hint:

1. Place both of the 6-column-wide elements next to each other on the grid.

2. Place all three of the 4-column-wide elements on the same row, and underneath that row place all four of the 3-column-wide elements.

3. Place this element all the way left on the grid, and then stack the remaining 4-column-wide pieces next to it and on top of each other.
