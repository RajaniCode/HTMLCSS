3.2.2 Baseline Adjustments

Adjust the type styles to adhere to the baseline.

A story has no beginning or end: arbitrarily one chooses that moment of experience from which to look back or from which to look ahead. I say 'one chooses' with the inaccurate pride of a professional writer who–when he has been seriously noted at all–has been praised for his technical ability, but do I in fact of my own will choose that black wet January night on the Common, in 1946, the sight of Henry Miles slanting across the wide river of rain, or did these images choose me? It is convenient, it is correct according to the rules of my craft to begin just there, but if I had believed then in a God, I could also have believed in a hand, plucking at my elbow, a suggestion, "Speak to him: he hasn't seen you yet." (Graham Greene, The End of The Affair)

Hint:

1. Leading should always be set to a 1.5 width.

2. With the leading at 1.5, adjust the font size until it fits on the baseline.

2. Set the type size to 20 and the leading to a 1.5 width.
