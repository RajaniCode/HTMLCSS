3.3.5 Asymmetrical Layouts

Use the elements to create a design that incorporates asymmetry

Hint:

1. Remember that asymmetrical layouts have a large off-center focal point, and that they utilize other elements to create balance.

2. Place the navigation and brand element at the top left of the layout, and then place the main content next to it.

3. Place each of these 3-column pieces side-by-side underneath the main content (next to the navigation), and then place the footer underneath all elements.
