3.3.4 Symmetrical Layouts

Use the elements to create a design that incorporates symmetry

Hint:

1. Remember that symmetrical layouts are equal on both sides of a vertical axis, all the elements should be centered on the grid.

2. Place the navigation and brand element at the top of the page and the main content underneath them.

3. Place each of these 3-column pieces side-by-side underneath the main content, and then place the footer underneath all elements.
