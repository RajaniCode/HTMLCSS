3.4.1 Layout

Using one of each element, create a layout that follows the principles of visual hierarchy

Hint:

1. Place the brand in the upper left of the layout, and then place the horizontal navigation directly next to the brand.

2. Drop the main content directly below the brand and navigation.

3. Place each secondary content element on the same row (directly below the main content), and then place the footer at the bottom of the layout.
