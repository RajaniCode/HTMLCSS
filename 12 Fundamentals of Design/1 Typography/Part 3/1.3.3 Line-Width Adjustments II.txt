1.3.3 Line-Width Adjustments II

Adjust the width of the container to ensure optimal characters per line (CPL).

A story has no beginning or end: arbitrarily one chooses that moment of experience from which to look back or from which to look ahead. I say 'one chooses' with the inaccurate pride of a professional writer who-when he has been seriously noted at all-has been praised for his technical ability, but do I in fact of my own will choose that black wet January night on the Common, in 1946, the sight of Henry Miles slanting across the wide river of rain, or did these images choose me? It is convenient, it is correct according to the rules of my craft to begin just there, but if I had believed then in a God, I could also have believed in a hand, plucking at my elbow, a suggestion, "Speak to him: he hasn't seen you yet." (Graham Greene, The End of The Affair)

Hint:

1. The optimal CPL ranges from 50-70 regardless of the type size.

2. The phrase "chooses that moment" contains characters 49-68 on the first line.
