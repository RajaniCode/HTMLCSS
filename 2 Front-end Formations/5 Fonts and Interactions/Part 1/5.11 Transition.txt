http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-transitions

Let’s add a nice transition to all of our links when they are hovered over. Using the individual properties, add a transition to the color property over the course of 1 second, with a 0 second delay, and the timing function of ease.

style.css

a {
  color: #c44743;
}

a:hover {
  color: #d56d68;
}

Answer:

a {
  color: #c44743;
  transition-duration: 1s;
  transition-property: background-color;
  transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
  transition-delay: 0s;
}

a:hover {
  color: #d56d68;
}
