4.12 Multiple Backgrounds

http://caniuse.com/#feat=multibackgrounds

We have two images, painting-01.jpg and painting-02.jpg. Using the separate background properties, add both images to the element. We want the first image at top left and the second image at center. Both images have no-repeat as the repeat value.

style.css

.element {

}

Answer:

.element {
  background-image: url(painting-01.png), url(painting-02.png);
  background-position: top left, center right;
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
}
