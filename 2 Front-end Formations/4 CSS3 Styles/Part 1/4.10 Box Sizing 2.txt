4.10 Box Sizing 2

http://caniuse.com/#

Now we want our inputs to have a width of 100%, but if we were to include the padding and border properties, they’d be pushed outside of that 100%. Using the box-sizing property, make the border and padding part of the width.

style.css

.input {
  border: 1px solid grey;
  padding: 7px 10px;
  width: 100%;
}

Answer:

.input {
  border: 1px solid grey;
  padding: 7px 10px;
  width: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
