1.3 Imports


To modularize our styles, we've separated some out to a partial called _settings.scss. Import the settings partial into application.scss, remembering that the underscore and file extension aren't necessary with Sass imports.


CSS

APPLICATION.SCSS


h1 {
  color: $color-base;
}

@import "settings";
