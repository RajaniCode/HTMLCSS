Media query 2


Assuming we have a 75px by 75px logo.png image and a high-resolution logo@2x.png image, include the high-resolution image within the media query you just wrote as a background-image on the .logo. Don't forget to set the background-size as well.

STYLE.CSS

Answer:

@media
only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),
only screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5) {
  .logo {
    background-image: url(logo@2x.png);
    -webkit-background-size: 75px 75px;
    background-size: 75px 75px;
  }
}
