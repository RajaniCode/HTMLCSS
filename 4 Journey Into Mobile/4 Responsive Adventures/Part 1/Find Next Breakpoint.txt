Find Next Breakpoint

Using the border handles on either side, keep resizing the site below to see where the logo and nav stack. Write the media query to the next breakpoint. Use the max-width property.

STYLE.CSS

Answer: @media screen and (max-width: 720px) {}

Note: 

On the 'rendered' tab, shrink the page until the layout breaks. Use the width at the time of the break (adding '20px') to create a media query to target that breakpoint.

Start your media query with @media to target the screen and a max-width of the breakpoint. 

@media screen and (max-width: 720px) { }
