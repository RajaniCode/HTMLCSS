Find the Breakpoint


Using the border handles on either side, keep resizing the site below to see where the logo breaks. Once you find it, write a media query to target that breakpoint, adding 20px to the breakpoint you find. Use the max-width property.

STYLE.CSS

Answer: @media screen and (max-width: 850px) {}


Note:

On the 'rendered' tab, shrink the page until the layout breaks. Use the width at the time of the break (adding '20px') to create a media query to target that breakpoint.

Start your media query with @media to target the screen and a max-width of the breakpoint + 20px.
    
The layout should break around '830px', leaving your 'max-width' at '850px'.


@media screen and (max-width: 850px) {
}
