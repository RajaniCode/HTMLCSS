2.3 Degrees and Turns


Degrees are just one value that can be set to a rotate transform to determine how much rotation should be applied. Fill in the blank with another value that accomplishes the same rotation as the code below but doesn't use degrees.

div {
  transform: rotate(360deg);
}



div {

  transform: rotate([  ]);

}


Answer: 1turn


/* Note: */

div {
  transform: rotate(360deg);
}



div {

  transform: rotate(1turn);

}
